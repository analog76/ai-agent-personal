I feel so bloated. I’m retaining more water than the Hoover Dam. What? Not another pimple? It’s like puberty all over again! Sleep? What’s that like? (I forget.:＜) Umm, I just turned 40….. Aren’t I too young for this?!? — Hello Friend. (Can I call you “friend”? ‘Cuz we’re already friends in my head:) Welcome to Are You There, Midlife? It’s Me, Monica. I’m Monica Lane Topete, Certified Nutrition Coach Coach, Peri+ Menopause Educator, Personal Trainer, NASM Behavior Change Specialist, and Hormone Imbalance Survivor. And I’m on a mission to help women in mid life balance their hormones naturally without drugs, doctors (or divorce!) It wasn’t too long ago when perimenopause came crashing through my door with a ton of luggage (‘cuz she was prepared to stay for A WHILE!) I remember how overwhelmed, anxious, and pretty much clueless I was about what was happening to my body…and how desperate I was for a diagnosis! But, after SEVERAL visits to my doctor who gave me a clean bill of health and lab results that came back “within normal range,” I finally decided to take my health into my own hands. I spent OVER A YEAR combing through PubMed research studies, taking online courses in naturopathy and functional medicine, and becoming my own human guinea pig to crack the hormone code and create a research-based program that really worked to balance my hormones, put the kibosh on perimenopause symptoms, and lose stubborn weight–and keep it off–for more than 10 years! And now, I want to share it with you. Join me as I demystify the hormonal transition in midlife and spill the ”tea” on what to expect when you’re expecting perimenopause…and beyond.

HUGE!)...and that only provide temporary relief without fixing the root problem. In this podcast, you’ll learn how to: - End painful periods, menstrual headaches, and PMS - Improve your sleep, reduce night sweats, and increase your overall energy - Reduce hormonal depression and anxiety–WITHOUT meds! - Alleviate symptoms of inflammation like joint pain, hair loss, gut issues, and allergies - Move the scale on stubborn weight and belly fat (and never starve yourself again!) - Talk to your partner about perimenopause (without sounding like you’re totally insane!) It’s TIME to take back control of your hormones and show ‘em who’s boss...so you can feel confident and love yourself again! ...Without ever stepping foot inside a doctor’s office or resorting to crazy hormone pellets. No need to make an appointment or even change outta your PJs. Just come as you are–wherever you are–as I discuss ALL things hormones in midlife–with a bit of saucy humor.

Steph and Beth talk about things that make most people uncomfortable (religion, mental illness, sexual abuse, and more). Steph and Beth became friends when they poured their hearts out in a 12-Step recovery small group. Neither was dealing with addiction—but both had hurts, habits, and hang-ups they needed to address. Steph’s journey is detailed in her book, Discovering My Scars, and that’s the inspiration for the podcast. While the podcast is inspired by Steph’s book, the hosts expand on subjects that make each person unique. The mission of the podcast is to help people embrace the “embarrassing” parts of their lives and learn to love and value all of themselves. On the podcast, the hosts share their own experiences and invite guests to broaden the conversation by contributing their own wisdom. As in Steph’s book, the podcast does not “tell you what to do,” rather, it has the ability to inspire people through the hosts’ honest and heartfelt approach.Podcast website: dospod.us",162,['en-US'],audio,TRUE

In the next few years, the FDA is likely to approve these mind-bending drugs for treating depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Some states have already decriminalized psilocybin, the active ingredient in ""magic"" mushrooms. But for all the headlines, many questions are swirling around this psychedelic renaissance. How do we make these drugs effective, safe and accessible to the people who need the most help? And how can they be used ethically, when much of the knowledge about plant medicines comes from Indigenous cultures? Psychedelics also raise profound questions about the nature of consciousness and mystical experience. People often describe their psychedelic experiences as “more real” than everyday life. Is this just an illusion, or do these experiences tap into some deeper reality? In “Luminous,” TTBOOK executive producer Steve Paulson explores the philosophical and cultural implications of psychedelics.

You’re far from alone. Living with symptoms has become the new normal. Much of the time, people coexist with their ailments, accepting them and never questioning why science and research hasn’t offered answers, as suffering has become the status quo. Sometimes though — an increasing amount of the time now — people’s symptoms start to impede their quality of life. They start to lose joys and privileges.

It happened to me, too! Anger, depression, and a bottomed-out libido played havoc on my marriage, career, and my relationship with my son long before I felt my first hot flash. In the aftermath of that wreckage, without any clue as to the true nature of the problem, I vowed to get fit and healthy, hoping that would at least allow me to survive the chaos that was my life. It worked - I lost weight, got fit, met a great guy, and even became a personal trainer, helping other women to lose weight and get fit. Like I said - it worked. That is, until it didn't. The weight started creeping back, and the weird, unpredictable symptom parade started again. Everything I'd worked to achieve was in danger of collapsing. This time, though, I knew I had to figure it out and the signs all pointed to menopause. I dug in, reading often outdated books and searching obscure references on the internet. I learned how our shifting reproductive hormones mess with every cell in our bodies. And as I realized how complete this hormonal disruption was, I became determined to help other women understand and control their own Menopause Journey. Because Menopause Matters.

2gjmbeGkbj9WCVjh54kBjx,Meta Lawsuit: Addictive to Kids,QP-1,"More than 40 US states and the District of Columbia are suing Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, alleging that the company has harmed children and teens by knowingly and deliberately designing features on its platforms that addict children to its products. The lawsuits allege that Meta has violated consumer protection laws by misleading users about the dangers of its platforms for young people. They also allege that Meta has violated federal law by collecting data on children under 13 without their parent's consent. Here are some of the key reasons why states are suing Meta:Addiction: The lawsuits allege that Meta has designed its platforms to be addictive, especially for young users. They point to features such as the infinite scroll, which keeps users scrolling through their feeds for hours on end, and the like button, which provides a social reward for posting and interacting with content.Harm to children: The lawsuits allege that Meta's platforms can harm children in a number of ways, including by increasing their risk of depression, anxiety, and eating disorders. They also allege that Meta's platforms can expose children to harmful content, such as cyberbullying and pornography.Data collection: The lawsuits allege that Meta violates federal law by collecting data on children under 13 without their parents' consent. Meta does this by tracking users' online activity and using cookies and other technologies to collect information about their interests and demographics.Meta has denied the allegations in the lawsuits. The company has said that it is committed to protecting young users and that it has taken steps to make its platforms safer for children. However, the lawsuits are still in their early stages, and it remains to be seen whether Meta will be held liable for the alleged harm to children and teens. What could happen next? The lawsuits against Meta are likely to go on for some time. The company has a lot of resources at its disposal, and it is likely to fight the allegations vigorously. However, if the states are successful, Meta could face significant financial and legal penalties. The lawsuits could also lead to changes in the way that Meta designs its platforms. If the company is found to have violated consumer protection laws, it could be forced to change its practices. This could include making it easier for users to opt out of data collection and giving parents more control over their children's online activity. The lawsuits against Meta are a significant development in the ongoing debate about the impact of social media on children and teens. If the states are successful, it could send a strong message to other tech companies about the need to protect young users. Thanks for listening to Quiet Please.

We’re licensed marriage and family therapists and trauma experts with over 30 years of combined experience. We’ve seen time and time again how people have tried to will themselves to be happy, muscle through it, and have ended up even worse off than when they began. We’ve noticed that people have experienced deep pain, whether it’s others who have hurt them or situations and the world just beating them down, and often they have turned that into an internal dialogue where they are mean...like really cruel in how they talk to themselves. They have anxiety, feel depressed and overwhelmed, all the while their self talk is telling them ”I’m not good enough, I’m a failure, I’m worthless, I’m not loveable, I cannot trust anyone, I am powerless, I’m not in control.” How emotionally exhausting! We’ve realized that people want to get out of that place, they just don’t know how. They feel lost, alone, and without hope. Mental health & recurring toxic relationships can feel like an uphill battle, but you are not alone in this, that’s where we come in!

3s6D1NBgOKYHFBZhe27Ye4,Narcissists in Divorce: The Narcissist Trap,Dr Supriya McKenna,"Narcissism expert Dr Supriya McKenna tackles head on the issues that occur when divorcing a narcissistic personality type. In this podcast she is often joined by veteran UK solicitor Karin Walker. In this podcast Dr Supriya offers up her years of experience working in this field, whilst interviewing a variety of allied professionals to also bring you their advice and expertise. A former family doctor, Supriya is a best selling author in the field of narcissism. Her new 2024 book, the first of her 'Narcissists in Divorce' series, is now available from Audible as an audiobook, as well as in paperback and Kindle formats. It's called Narcissists in Divorce: From Love-Locked to Leaving, and it will teach you how to assess whether your partner is a true narcissist. With easy-to-read case histories and in-depth questionnaires, you’ll learn about narcissistic personality disorder (NPD), and how to deconstruct narcissistic behaviours. You'll discover the predictable divorce and separation behaviours to expect from a narcissist, and their impact on you and your children. You’ll also learn why these relationships are so difficult to break free from, and why you may be struggling. With guidance to help you decide whether or not to leave your relationship, you’ll also learn essential strategies to build your resilience – regardless of what choice you ultimately make. The second book in the series - Narcissists in Divorce: From Leaving to Liberty – The Truth, The Whole Truth and Nothing But The Truth is also out now. Supriya felt compelled to write it after becoming aware of the many important legal and post-separation issues that had not been dealt with in her 2021 book, Divorcing a Narcissist: The Lure, The Loss and the Law. Exposing the dangerous inadequacies of family justice systems across the world, From Leaving to Liberty is an in depth, holistic, no nonsense guide to navigating child-related and financial issues that occur during divorce. It details how to minimize and deal with post separation abuse, how to parent alongside a narcissist, and how to make up for the deficiencies of the narcissistic parent to protect your children. Legal strategies for both the finances and children issues are covered in detail, as are physiological hacks to help you cope with the divorce process, which, sadly, is abusive in itself. Dr Supriya even covers how to recognize and deal with narcissistic divorce lawyers; how exactly to find a lawyer who can help you; court ordered psychological evaluations; and much much more. Supriya has trained thousands of family law professionals in how to manage narcissistic divorces.

Dana Takagi,"Welcome to ""Opening Dharma Access,"" a podcast where we hear stories from BIPOC teachers & practitioners about their Dharma experiences and practice, and how those inform the ways they are sharing & practicing the Dharma today. Season 3 description: Hosted by Rev. Liên & Rev. Dana TakagiThis season, we will have a new focus: Uplifting and Forwarding Asian American/Asian Diasporic Buddhist Experiences in the West.With our guests and audience, we will explore the specificities of Asian American/Asian Diasporic experiences. We take as given that there are generational differences (hence the historical moment matters!) and we hope to also delve into Asian family norms and values, our inchoate understanding of ancestor worship, issues of identity, representation, stereotypes about sexuality and sexual identity, and Asian American depression. A theme we'll be using to help guide our conversations is The Disquiet - a term we are adapting from writer/poet Fernando Pessoa (The Book of Disquiet) -- which, in our view, signals a complex recognition of self, mind, and body. The evidence for the foregoing includes scholarly research indexed in aggregate statistics on depression, youth suicide, and other issues in immigrant or first-generation families. While Asian Americans are not alone in experiencing trauma, the racial languages and discourses of othering are different for us than for other groups. What do we hope is the outcome of this podcast? Our first aim is to give voice to the range and depth of Buddhism in Asian and Asian American generations. We hope, in doing so, we help to shine a light on the limited or myopic envisioning of race in primarily white sanghas. Asian and Asian American diasporic truths about practice are a teaching for contemporary dharma organizations and centers. We recognize the depth and range of Asian and Asian Diasporic Buddhists is a wisdom mirror for organized Buddhism in the West.Thank you to the Hemera Foundation for their generous support of Season 3!

But when she entered the fire service, she was ostracized by those who weren't willing to accept a girl into their ranks. Constant microaggressions, overt sexism, and instances of sexual violence wore her down until she no longer believed she could safely exist in the world. The trauma of her experiences eventually resulted in a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder, and that diagnosis was a first step toward healing. In the years since, Ali has worked as a domestic violence and sexual assault counselor, an advocate for abused children, an inspirational speaker, and a crisis counselor for first responders. On her journey of recovery, she has collected other people's stories of resilience. After Trauma explores the fallout from trauma, the ripples those experiences have on our lives, and finally, a path toward healing.

I’m Dr. Desiree Cassell, a Doctor of Physical Therapy that specializes in Women’s Health aka Pelvic Floor, a wife, mom of 3, foodie and lover of all things movement and mindfulness (bonus if it’s outdoors)! I can’t tell you how excited I am that you are here checking out The Balanced Momtality Women’s Health and Wellness Podcast! During my first pregnancy I experienced all the typical issues like DRA, urinary incontinence, pelvic organ prolapse (POP) and even hemorrhoids 😳. Only to be told “welcome to #momlife” by society and other moms in my life. So, like you, I accepted it as “normal”. Then, while working for my Doctor of Physical Therapy, I got pregnant with my second (still dealing with all the same issues and more 6 yrs later) and decided to put my new found knowledge to the test. YOU GUYS I was able to not only stop my urinary incontinence and prolapse from getting worse, I STOPPED LEAKING AND FEELING SYMPTOMS ALL TOGETHER! This is when my passion for educating, empowering and supporting other women and moms was born. I just knew I had to shout it from the rooftops that all those “common” symptoms ARE NOT NORMAL! You do not have to suffer and there IS HELP! Unfortunately, I brought all these issues up to my providers during my first pregnancy, only to be brushed off and told to do kegels and exercise. With that advice, I kegeld my life away and took a Pilates class postpartum that actually turned my DRA into an umbilical hernia and caused pain with intercourse because kegels were actually the opposite of what my pelvic floor needed (more on that inside the podcast 😉). Inside this podcast you will learn all about the pelvic floor and core system, common dysfunctions within the system during pregnancy and postpartum (and in general), how to connect and be aware of your body’s limits and how to SAFELY push those limits so you can be the strong, confident, and happy balanced momma you and your family deserve! Now let’s get you out of those pads and back to jumping on the trampoline with your kids and enjoying movement again! Put those airpods in, grab your water, roll out your mat and let’s connect!

In this podcast, I'll open up about my experiences with this complex brain disorder while also providing a comprehensive overview of schizophrenia itself. Despite sharing common symptoms, each individual's journey with schizophrenia is unique. We all seek tools and strategies to manage our symptoms within the context of our unique lives.As mental health consumers, we are responsible for sharing our experiences openly and honestly. By doing so, we can help combat the stigma associated with schizophrenia. We can empower listeners to understand what psychosis truly feels like, dispelling the fear and misconceptions that often surround it. While a schizophrenic episode can be an intense and overwhelming experience, it's important to remember that the person experiencing it is usually not a threat to others.Beyond my experiences with schizophrenia, I'll also share aspects of my life that transcend my mental health condition. This serves as a reminder that mental health consumers are multifaceted individuals, not defined solely by their diagnoses.My fiction novel, ""The Overlife: A Tale of Schizophrenia,"" is based on a deeply personal exploration of my own experiences and those of my mother. It's available as a Kindle and paperback book (visit https://www.amazon.com/author/diana_dirkby or search for ""Diana Dirkby"" on Amazon). An audiobook version will be released soon. For more information, please visit my website: https://overliveschizophrenia.com/.Part 1 of this podcast aired during the prepublication phase of my novel.

If you have found yourself in midlife with a few extra love-handles that won't budge, and a brain that seems to feel depressed (or worse), then this podcast channel is designed with you in mind. You're not alone. There is a direct relationship between middle-age, extra body weight and mental illness. With the help of my guests, I hope to show you ways that you can take control of your life again, and return to a body that is fit, healthy and happy. We don't burn incense. You don't need to grow hairy legs and we don't use gongs to help you feel better (you can if you want, but that's not how our systems work). Come listen to my guests, who have lost loads of weight, or they have overcome mental illness, and have become healthy and energetic as a result. Chronic mental illnesses such as depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and even Parkinson's have all be forced back into remission by my guests who can talk the talk because they have personally walked the walk! You can control your own illnesses too. You just need to know how. And I promise that calorie-restriction is generally not part of our conversation. Physical chronic illnesses can include heart disease, high blood pressure, so called ""high cholesterol"", lack of energy, arthritis, gout, and type 2 diabetes, to scratch the surface. These methods can also help you control your type 1 diabetes. This is a podcast all about improving your health, both physically & mentally. My guests & I discuss ways you can regain your health, regardless of your chronic illness, or even if you are just not happy with your current weight. My podcasts discuss all the ways that you can increase your health, lose significant body fat, tone up, restore your hormonal balances and take charge of your life. I'll also discuss exercises and all sorts of subjects related to your health and well-being. Please also read my book, also called See Your Toes Again, available exclusively on Amazon. My caveat: if you are on medication, please do not attempt to cease your medications until you have spoken with your specialist, and they are confident your health has improved enough that you don't need to use them anymore.

Are you a self-proclaimed perfectionist constantly worried about what others think of you? Do you feel childhood and family patterns repeating themselves in your marriage or relationships? Did the pink cloud fade a long time ago only to be replaced with the restlessness, irritability, and discontent of those familiar drunken days? Maybe you’re a high achiever and on the outside, you have everything you need and even some of the things you want - but you’re still feeling dissatisfied. People see success when they look at you but all you see when you look in the mirror is a person you don’t even recognize - just like those 3am accidental glimpses in the mirror when you were crying in the bathroom. Desperate for a solution & crying out to a God you weren’t sure you even believed in. OH desperation - what a gift that was! In this podcast you’re gonna hear stories of hope for sober living. Stories with solutions to emotional health, relationships, and that critical inner voice as well as transparent and authentic conversations about navigating mental health, faith, and relationships in recovery. My name’s Felicia and I’m a 12-stepper turned therapist. I’m married and I have two littles under 5. I grew up in church but I didn’t find Jesus or understand grace until I found the rooms of AA in 2011. I love Jesus but have had my fair share of struggling with church culture and religion. I know what it’s like to be stuck in a restless, irritable, and discontent rut (drunk & sober). This next season I’m going to be shifting the podcast focus to stories of hope for sober living. This change comes after a year of podcasting and recognizing more than ever the power of storytelling and my hope to reach a larger audience of listeners seeking a solution to their addiction in addition to solutions for living sober. There will still at times be a focus on reaching parents in recovery since this is such a huge part of my recovery, but not all my guests who will be sharing their experience, strength, and hope, will be parents.

Like us all, Terrence had his own personal back ‘story’ (a ‘me’) which has included sexual abuse as a child, living in a dysfunctional and broken family followed by drug addiction, divorce, depression and anxiety with suicidal thoughts. During his journey, he consulted various psychologists and therapists and pursued a variety of spiritual paths and self-help groups. Nothing seemed to relieve the deep-seated experience of separation and isolation, until he met Sailor Bob Adamson. Here Terrence gained an intellectual understanding of Non-Duality and then his sense of self (me) finally collapsed.

At first, the police thought they were dealing with an open-and-shut case, suspecting that it was Sheila Caffell – diagnosed with schizophrenia – who had shot her adoptive parents and twin sons before turning the gun on herself. As one detective set out to prove, however, certain elements of that narrative that didn’t add up – and the spotlight turned to Sheila’s brother, Jeremy Bamber. In the new companion podcast to the HBO Max limited series The Murders at White House Farm, host Lauren Bright Pacheco speaks with the show’s creators, as well as with Carol Ann Lee -- author of the book The Murders at White House Farm -- and Colin Caffell, the father of the two young boys. Each episode of the podcast takes a deeper dive into one of six nuanced themes that contributed to the particularly disturbing nature of this surprisingly complicated case, providing further context and background for this horrific crime.",7,['en'],audio,FALSE

2KHWSCO6FDp5QjWZHfy35G,VOICES with Amber B Skylar,Amber B Skylar,"Have you ever wanted to talk out loud about being sexually assaulted? Or has society taught you that you were not strong enough to handle it? What about other subjects like single parenting, gaslighting, or women and religion? I am the expert on my trauma and have spent 30 years in therapy for low self-esteem, low self-worth, depression, and anger – all while getting up over and over only to be beat down by the cultural norms. However, even after being raped, suicidal thoughts, sexual harassment, military sexual trauma, homelessness, and surviving against a tsunami of ""you can't do it"" mindset, I managed to write a book called ""Colors of Amber, A Memoir"" and won a scholarship to be a yoga teacher from the Kripalu School of Yoga. Writing and yoga shredded years of torment and shame as it cut into my neural sheath – pathways that reminded me that I was female and less than. I once heard a psychiatrist say that “depression is the silencing of the soul”. It hit me. If I ever wanted to feel free, happy, joyful, and to have healthy anger, that talking, writing, speaking, and bringing all the “dirty secrets” to light was the ticket. It would hurt either way. Podcasting is another tool - therapeutic and transforming - that in 2021 gives women a voice and people are listening. In my ""VOICES with Amber B Skylar"" podcast, I share content to inspire, uplift, and plunge a listener into her/his nature, so you can see it, grieve it, get help and thrive. My goal is to be the voice of those who cannot speak up. I purposefully aim to show what empowerment as a woman really can be – self-inquiry, self-assessment of one's actions, contributions, beliefs. I am committed to my craft will dedicate talent, skill, research, compassion, and relentless energy to uphold the voices of women and the men who love and support them – and to healing future generations of humans. -Amber B Skylar, Author, Colors of Amber, A Memoir (Amazon).

3AP7IBkqmQmUVCO7dbiTYI,Weaver of My Web,The Master Fire Weaver - Erika Ryles,"This podcast is a follow-up to my book. I am here to bring messages to the deaf and visions to the blind. We have lost sense of who we are as human beings and frequently misunderstand this experience because of how society has poised us to be unaware of the very thing we live in. In our struggles to find our ways past the traumas that likely began in childhood, we’ve developed a disconnect as we aged that we call by many names – such as, anxiety, depression, and fear. But, it’s simply mental and spiritual discord. Thus, we live chaotic, despair-ridden lives that reflect the chaos and despair within – as within, so without. It’s beyond the time to find and reconnect to our untraveled pathways, and to fully embrace and heal & evolve in that process. Many people have been slapped with clues of their duties here and didn’t recognize them for what they were. Then, they usually follow with some reasoning like, “well, it just wasn’t my time.” The Universe doesn’t have imperfect anything, much less imperfect timing. It can’t give you what you aren’t aligned for, and that slap was only ignored, misunderstood, or refused by you. We have to stop with the excuse of being human when we don’t fully understand what our humanity is or not living fully in the experience, whilst denying the very things we need or desire to have because society tells us to. The pain and trauma we all have endured, with a great majority of it coming from our younger years, were only to help bring us back into ourselves to find our innate strengths; not for us to retreat in weakness from who we truly are. We are to learn from it all. We must, also, accept and love our flaws (while not becoming them) and any trauma that may have created them, so we can move on in life through genuine forgiveness of ourselves and others, mental and spiritual growth, and creating Infinite Sustainability™ on our individual journeys. So, in other words, get your shit together people. The world is waiting on you to finally show the fuck up for it, and yourselves! I am very passionate about humanity being and doing better, and you will hear that passion through histrionics. Messages come to me at any given time so the recordings may not always be superior as I did/will record wherever I am. I am not going to follow how someone else says I should because my every day is filled with that in my professional environments. I will ramble & speed-talk all while discussing many topics, but the main theme will be how those things pertain to the human experience and the mind, and being better at navigating both. I am going to be real and it will always be rooted in truth. Seemingly, truth is missing in this reality simulation because people are too sensitive to look at themselves without deflecting or bathing in the energy of paralyzing fear of others’ judgments that may not even happen. Screw any naysaying, negative hoes. I am, also, not going to follow any rules or complicate any of this, just to sew more confusion like history has shown will lead us willingly off an Everest-sized cliff. Real shit only. Authenticity, brilliance, and love of all will be the order of every day here. If you are put off by a little profanity, go elsewhere at your loss. Everyone else, you will be enlightened and entertained. I know you will enjoy what I bring, even the hard stuff. Lastly, if you enjoy these episodes, share and support this podcast. Thereafter, go buy my damn book already! No need to be late for everything, geez.I apologize for nothing and change only my underwear. Happy listening, my lovlies!",25,['en-US'],audio,TRUE

4GvHj8IRpAPJGHqh95tQne,"When Marriage Hurts Podcast - Help for Christian Women in Painful Marriages, Emotional Abuse in Marriage, Trauma in Marriage",Ola Davies | Marital abuse coach,"Are you tired of trying to figure out this thing called marriage? Do your attempts to seek Godly counsel for your marriage leave you feeling confused and frustrated? Have you attended marriage seminars and joined prayer lines but your marriage doesn’t seem to improve? Do you feel trapped and alone in your marriage and no one seems to understand the pain you experience? Does your marriage look spotless - even perfect - on the outside but on the inside you know you are barely hanging on by a thread? Are you afraid of confiding in someone because you know they would never believe the experiences you’ve had in marriage? Has your marriage become the source of your greatest pain? Or even though you hate to admit it but you are at your happiest and most at peace when your husband isn’t around? Hey Sis, my name is Ola Davies, Daughter of the Most High God, mom to two beautiful children and a lover of all things marriage. I remember what it felt like to give my marriage my all but the more I tried the more my efforts fell flat. I followed all the church rules and tried to build my home like the proverbial wise woman but no matter how hard I tried, I always fell short. Counselling didn’t seem to help. My marriage was falling apart, my life was falling apart, I was dying on the inside and no matter how loudly my heart screamed, no one seemed to hear my cry for help. I sank into a deep depression and lost the desire to live. Waking up every morning became a painful experience. I’d pray to sleep and never wake up, convinced my life was worthless and of no use to anyone. Then I thought about my children and what would become of them. I didn’t want to cheat them out of having a healthy loving mother. I felt such a sense of responsibility towards them considering they were miracle babies whom I conceived after battling with infertility. The thought of my 6 month-old baby who was still breast-fed, growing up without any memories of me saddened me. I cried to God for strength to live one day at a time and I realized he was right by me the whole time. Even when I thought he was distant, he was near. God showed me my life mattered to him more than my marriage. He told me I would rise beyond this, I would be a mother to my children and my life still had meaning and purpose. That marked the beginning of my healing journey. I’m on that path of healing and restoration and instead of despair, I have a new zest for life. My mission is to guide you to that place of light and truth in Christ so you too can begin your healing journey; so you can live the best life God has planned for you. In this podcast, we will be exposing the religious lies that the enemy uses to make our marriages a place of pain and confusion and we will also be discovering the truth in Christ that sets us free. I’d love to share with you how Jesus set me free from hopelessness and despair.. He is more than willing to do the same for you too; willing to take that heavy burden off your shoulders. Grab yourself a cup of tea, get in your most comfy pyjamas and let’s have some fun! “Come to Me, all who are weary and heavily burdened [by religious rituals that provide no peace], and I will give you rest [refreshing your souls with salvation] - Matt 11:28 Let’s connect!
